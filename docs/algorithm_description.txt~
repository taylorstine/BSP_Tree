One of the key problems in computer adided design and graphics is deremining what objects are visible relative to one another, with a constantly changing viewpoint.  Furthermore, the problem of surface to surface interference is difficult to classify for models with a complex geometry.  When a scene or rendeirng consists of several models, this problem becomes even more difficult.
    In order to resolve these issues, graphics software engineers utilize a spatial data structure known as a binary space partitioning tree (a.k.a. BSP tree).  The BSP tree represents a way to recursively divide a scene along two sides of a plane, until some partitioning criterion is met
